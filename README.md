# Poolesville High School Science, Math, and Computer Science

This is an early development of what *should* turn out to be a continually updated and thriving space for students to access resources related to different projects, and provide code after completing them.

Please move any repos related to any of the projects here! Owners will handle the read/write permissions and ensure that protected branches remain... protected.

Here be dragons!
